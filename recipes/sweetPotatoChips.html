            <p>
                Use your air fryer to make these yummy sweet potato chips. 
                After much experimenting I found that the best chips came from a mandoline that was set just a hair thicker than 1/16 inch (about 3/32 inch thick).

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large (8 ounces) sweet potato</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Slice potato into 1/16-inch-thick rounds using a mandoline. 
                    Put potato slices in a large bowl of cold water; soak about 20 minutes. 
                    Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Wipe out bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return potato slices to dried bowl. Add oil, salt, and pepper; toss gently to coat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                    Lightly coat air fryer basket with cooking spray. 
                    Working in batches if needed, arrange potato slices in an even layer in basket (do not overcrowd).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook until lightly golden and crispy, 12 to 16 minutes, turning and rearranging chips into an even layer every 4 minutes. 
                    Watch closely during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking. 
                    Check chips about every 30 seconds, using tongs to remove golden chips from the basket as needed to avoid overcooking and ending up with bitter chips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let chips cool about 5 minutes. 
                    Chips will continue to crisp as they cool. 
                    Store in an airtight container up to 3 days.
                </li>
            </ol>
